        how to score a user based on activity


Project Milestones

    autobot would checkin in at set intervals and request deliverables
        conversation style requests / responses
            score based on deliverables met
                actions on deliverables failed

Automatic tasks

    near the end of cohorts take all the top users and message them
    about being a mentor

    New / returning users to Chingu Cohort
        Sorting Hat will provide the teams / team members
        AutoBot will then create a channel and insert the team members

    Monitoring channels
        user activity is low [team / other channel]
            message them to engage
                if no response then second message
                    decide whether to move / remove then
                        (generate a ticket and / or message chance with user name)
                            give details in the ticket/message about the user
                                data
                                previous contact attempts
                                    replies

                            chance makes final decision
                                bot moves / removes
