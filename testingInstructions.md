### Why help?

##### Early access to learning the ins and outs of the app and its features

##### Contribute to improving a Chingu community tool

##### Get a unique betaTester badge on your profile

##### Get credited as a beta tester in the GitHub readme


## Steps
* Create a profile at FORM URL. The username you use for your profile must match your username on Slack
* Join the slack testing team entering the same user name
* Call your profile in the testing team using `/profile @yourUserName` to confirm its creation.
* If your profile is not found message @vampiire for further instructions

### The Update Command
##### Learn how to use the `/update` command

* Call the help guide
    * command: `/update help 1` for the first version
        * version 1 is a longer guide that displays all of the sub-guides at once.
    * command: `/update help 2` for the second version
        * version 2 contains the general information about the command as well as instructions on how to call the sub-guides
    * note: both versions respond to the sub-guides commands

After reading the help guide copy and paste this message into the channel and enter your responses. Yes / no is fine but feel free to provide detail:
```
1. Did you prefer version 1 or version 2?

2. Was the guide clear or is there anything you are still confused about?

3. Was the guide structured in an intuitive way or can you suggest moving any items or changing the markdown?

4. Any other suggestions / alternatives / complaints / bugs?
```

##### Use the /update command
List of update items: `blog, certifications, gitHub, picture, portfolio, projects, skills, story`
* Update one of each item using appropriate flags as needed
    * if you make a mistake you should receive an error message explaining how to fix it.
    * If you dont receive an error response for your erroneous command send a message with the command you entered and any additional notes.
    * if you forget which flags to use or the correct format you can call the sub-guide for that item at any time.

After using the update command copy and paste this message into the channel and enter your responses. Yes / no is fine but feel free to provide detail:
```
1. Was the git-style interface intuitive / convenient to you or do you have an alternative approach to updating you would like to suggest?
2. Were the error messages clear and helpful in guiding you towards fixing your error?
3. Would you use the update command in the future? If not, why? (you can be honest)
4. Any other suggestions / alternatives / complaints / bugs?
```

### The Check-in Command
##### Use the `/checkin` command

* Call the check-in command for yourself and a partner(s)
    * command: `/checkin` with no parameters
* Call the check-in command with some partner(s)
    * command: `/checkin [@partner] [@partner2]`for any number of partners you choose
* Soft reset the check-in command
    * command: `/checkin` with or without partners
        * when you get to the confirmation message choose reset
        * select different choices then submit
    * note: a soft reset will keep the original partners but allow you to change your choice of check-in type and activity

After using the check-in command copy and paste this message into the channel and enter your responses. Yes / no is fine but feel free to provide detail:
```
1. Was the check-in process intuitive / convenient for you?

```

## Review
If you have any other questions / suggestions / comments / complaints send a message to @vampiire in the Slack testing team.

In particular I am looking for suggestions on additional data that would be good to store in the user profiles.

Thank you for your help I really appreciate your time. If you ever need my help feel free to message me. I am up and coding most of the day and especially through the night.

#### I expect a lot of server crashing as a result of this area of testing. Because of this I will need to schedule 15-30 minute (up to you on duration) individual sessions with anyone interested so it doesn't impact the rest of the beta testing.

I can work on your schedule and will screen share with you to be able to mark down the issue and reset the server immediately for another try.

##### Break the `/update`, `/checkin`, and `/profile` commands
* please try _anything_ you can to break each of the commands
* if you do not receive an error message for your attempt send a message with the command you entered and any additional notes.
* If you break the command send a message with the command you entered and any additional notes.
